# react-native-redux-sqlite-navigation
React Native Starter Application with SQLite Plugin in and using Redux with Navigation.


This application uses SQLite to store data inside it and SQLiteProvider is designed in Singleton pattern. Since understanding 
  complexity of Redux is hard, combining Redux with Navigation and SQLite was such a pain for me. I hope it works and shows people
  who are interested in React Native with Redux some way to move on.
